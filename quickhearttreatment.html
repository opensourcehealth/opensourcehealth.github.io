Heart disease is partly caused by nutrient deficiencies, poor sleep position, toilet position and lack of grounding. Some deficiencies for heart disease are magnesium, silica, and vitamins D and K2.</p>

<h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p>To cure heart disease, take a good multivitamin which has organic magnesium and vitamin K2, to ensure a sufficient supply of magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin K2. Most multivitamins do not have organic magnesium and vitamin K2, Naturelo is one of the <a href="multivitamin.html#vendors">few brands</a> that have both. They have a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-50-plus">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-240">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-men-240">version for men.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://inclinedbedtherapy.com/research">Inclined bed therapy</a> reduces blood sugar, improves digestion, and helps with many other illnesses. Raise the head of the bed by some means, one way is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB654-Furniture-Risers-Supports/dp/B01FN4KGD8">with 2" bed risers.</a> A 2" rise is suggested to start, because unless there is a footboard, with a higher rise the mattress will slide down. If there is a footboard, the rise can be higher, up to 8".</p>

<p>A toilet footstool reduces <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/Fulltext/2019/03000/Implementation_of_a_Defecation_Posture.21.aspx">strain at stool,</a> which would otherwise cause blood pressure rise, which can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jch.13489">trigger cardiovascular events.</a></p>

<p>Earthing improves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/">heart rate variability (HRV), and decreases red blood cell (RBC) aggregation.</a> The easiest way to start earthing is to put an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Earthing-Grounding-Computer-Inflammation-Reconnect/dp/B07PNGWDQX">earthing mat on a desk</a> used for typing or writing.</p>

<p>Silica <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2003/4/report_silicon">strengthens collagen,</a> and it should be obtained from drinking water, to avoid the side effects that silica supplements often have. Silica itself is safe, but silica has to be combined with something to be absorbed in a supplement, and that something can have side effects. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Berkey-Gravity-Fed-Purification-Elements/dp/B00FMUYU6I">Berkey water filter</a> has a fine silica filter stage which puts some silica into the water. It's not much, but because it's pure silica in water, there are no side effects. The Berkey water filter is not designed to put silica in the water, it is just a fortunate side effect of its filter. The only problem with the Berkey is that it comes with a plastic spigot, if you buy a Berkey you should get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTSKYTMStainless-Beverage-Dispenser-Replacement-inchï¼‰Opening/dp/B00SLENBQM">stainless steel spigot.</a></p>

<h3><a id="explanation">Explanation</a></h3>
<h4><a id="multivitamin">Multivitamin</a></h4>
<p>A multivitamin must have a magnesium in organic form because the inorganic form, magnesium oxide, has only <a href="https://www.vitacost.com/blog/types-of-magnesium/">a 4% bioavailability.</a> Multivitamins have calcium and magnesium, calcium is essential but if it is not balanced with a similar quantity of magnesium it leads to arterial calcification. When a multivitamin has magnesium oxide, the magnesium is not being absorbed in a similar quantity, so the person will get arterial calcification.</p>

<p>Vitamin K2 is necessary to move calcium from places it does not belong, like arteries, to places where it does belong, like bones and teeth, making <a href="https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2016/12/09/the-ultimate-vitamin-k2-resource/">bones strong and teeth resistant to cavities.</a> Only vitamin K2 does this, vitamin K1 does not. Vitamin K2 in supplements is usually in the MK-7 or MK-4 form. To get the same bone building effect, <a href="https://www.vitamink2.ca/best-form-of-vitamink2">about 20 times more MK-4 is required than MK-7.</a> The typical dose for MK-7 is 45 to 120 mcg/day, and the typical dose for MK-4 is 1,000 to 3,000 mcg/day (1 to 3 mg/day). If the supplement does not say what type it is, then don't take it because there's no way to know if it has enough vitamin K2 to be effective.</p>

<p>Naturelo is one of the few brands that has organic magnesium and a significant amount of vitamin K2, around 120 mcg of vitamin K2 MK-7. They have a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-50-plus">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-240">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-men-240">version for men.</a> Their products are available in many places, including Amazon which also has a version <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06XPTH9H2">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01FYDIP4K">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/NATURELO-Whole-Food-Multivitamin-Men/dp/B01FYDCGZ4">version for men.</a></p>

<p>There are many ingredients in their supplement, to be safe, start with one a day, and after a week, if there are no adverse effects, boost that by another one a day. Keep doing this until you reach the four a day recommendation, or just before you reach a dose which has adverse effects for you. If you get adverse effects from the whole food multivitamin at even the minimum dose, you can try their one a day version, it has fewer ingredients, so it hopefully doesn't have whatever you're reacting to, it's also cheaper. They have a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/one-daily-multivitamin-women-50-plus">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/one-daily-multivitamin-women-60">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/mens-health/products/one-daily-multivitamin-men-60">version for men.</a></p>

<p>If no Naturelo product works for you, another good multivitamin is Legion - Triumph Multivitamin, which has organic magnesium and 100 mcg/day of vitamin K2. Women under fifty should take the <a href="https://legionathletics.com/products/supplements/triumph-women/">version with iron</a>, men and women over fifty should take the <a href="https://legionathletics.com/products/supplements/triumph-men/">version without iron.</a></p>

<h4><a id="inclinedbedtherapy">Inclined Bed Therapy</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://inclinedbedtherapy.com/research">Inclined bed therapy</a> reduces blood sugar, improves digestion, and helps with many other illnesses. Raise the head of the bed by some means, one way is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB654-Furniture-Risers-Supports/dp/B01FN4KGD8">with 2" bed risers.</a> A 2" rise is suggested to start, because unless there is a footboard, with a higher rise the mattress will slide down. If there is a footboard, the rise can be higher, up to 8". A pack of four bed risers cost about 12$, so on a yearly basis, this is the least expensive medical treatment.</p>

<h4><a id="toiletfootstool">Toilet Footstool</a></h4>
<p>A toilet footstool reduces strain at stool and <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/Fulltext/2019/03000/Implementation_of_a_Defecation_Posture.21.aspx">increases bowel emptiness.</a> Strain at stool causes blood pressure rise, which can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jch.13489">trigger cardiovascular events</a> such as congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, acute coronary disease, and aortic dissection. A toilet footstool also eases constipation and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/squatty-potty-what-is#1">reduces the chance of hemorrhoids.</a> The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Squatty-Potty-Original-Bathroom-Toilet/dp/B00ESKVN7W">squatty potty</a> footstool costs about 25$.</p>

<h4><a id="earthing">Earthing</a></h4>
<p>Earthing improves heart rate variability (HRV), and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/">decreases red blood cell (RBC) aggregation.</a> The easiest way to start earthing is to put an earthing mat on a desk used for typing or writing. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Earthing-Grounding-Computer-Inflammation-Reconnect/dp/B07PNGWDQX">desk earthing mat</a> costs about 33$.</p>

<h4><a id="berkeywaterfilter">Berkey Water Filter</a></h4>
<p>Aluminum is toxic and the Berkey water filter <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/047373_Big_Berkey_water_filter_ProPur_lab_tests.html">removes aluminum.</a> Silica <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2003/4/report_silicon">strengthens collagen,</a> and it should be obtained from drinking water, to avoid the side effects that silica supplements often have. Silica itself is safe, but silica has to be combined with something to be absorbed in a supplement, and that something can have side effects. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Berkey-Gravity-Fed-Purification-Elements/dp/B00FMUYU6I">Berkey water filter</a> has a fine silica filter stage which puts some silica into the water. It's not much, but because it's pure silica in water, there are no side effects. The Berkey water filter is not designed to put silica in the water, it is just a fortunate side effect of its filter. The only problem with the Berkey is that it comes with a plastic spigot, if you buy a Berkey you should get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTSKYTMStainless-Beverage-Dispenser-Replacement-inchï¼‰Opening/dp/B00SLENBQM">stainless steel spigot.</a> The Berkey travel water filter costs 300$, the stainless steel spigot costs 10$, for a total of 310$. After filtering 6,000 gallons, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Berkey-Black-Purification-Elements-Pack/dp/B00BWIWW1Y">two black Berkey purification elements</a> have to be replaced. They cost about 130$, which works out to a cost of about 2 cents per gallon. Of these four heart gifts, the Berkey water filter is the most popular one.</p>

<p>The multivitamin is a capsule, so it is quick to take. If you have more free time, or you have a heart problem, then you should also get oral chelation, as described in the <a href="basichearttreatment.html">basic heart treatment.</a></p>

To boost your mom's health, provide nutrients including [url=https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2016/12/09/the-ultimate-vitamin-k2-resource/]vitamin K2,[/url] and support blood vessels with the [url=https://jeffreydachmd.com/heart-disease-vitamin-c-and-linus-pauling2/]Pauling/Rath therapy,[/url] which starts with vitamin C and lysine. The best multivitamin for your mom which has vitamin K2 and organic magnesium is the [url=https://naturelo.com/product/whole-food-multivitamin-for-women-iron-free/]Naturelo whole food multivitamin for post menopausal women (iron free).[/url]

I recommend the 4 capsule/day multivitamin for your mom instead of the one daily multivitamin because old people are more likely to have a detox reaction. With the 4 capsule/day final dose multivitamin, your mom could start with one per day, and slowly increase her dose to four per day, or whatever she can take without side effects. The final vitamin C and lysine dose for your mom should be 3 g/day of each. Start her at 500 mg/day for each, and slowly increase the dose until she reaches 3 g/day, or whatever she can take without side effects. The [url=https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Vitamin-Crystals-Ascorbic-Powder/dp/B00028LX1U]vitamin C[/url] and [url=https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-L-Lysine-Powder-500-Grams/dp/B00333D4VS]lysine[/url] should be bought as powders, so there are no fillers and fewer capsules to take. The powders should be mixed into a cold drink that she likes, preferably a fruit juice because the vitamin C and lysine will definitely mix well in there, but milk is probably ok. A convenient way is to mix enough for three days in a [url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BSW5LXY]glass bottle with a sleeve,[/url] then put that in the fridge, and ask her to drink some with each meal.

The above will boost your mom's health, with a relatively small amount of time and money. It also worth doing for everyone else who is middle aged or older. To be clear, women under fifty should use the women under fifty version of the multivitamin, and men should use the multivitamin for men.

If you have more time and money, and she is willing to take more supplements, you can give her the health and energy she had when she was middle aged, by reducing her arterial calcification, which almost all old people have. To safely reduce calcification, the arteries must be further strengthed, to prevent bleeding and/or aneurysms. The Pauling/Rath therapy strengthens arteries, the more of it you use, the stronger the arteries. Also, soft plaque must also be stabilized to prevent it from breaking off then blocking a blood vessel when it is dissolved, causing a stroke. Gotu kola (centella asiatica) contains triterpenoid compounds that help [url=https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2017/5/arterial-plaque-rupture]stabilize soft plaque.[/url] These treatments would boost her health, and make it possible to safely use aggressive calcification reduction treatments like oral chelation, delta tocotrienol, grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), and lipophospheric EDTA, which in turn would further boost her health to middle aged level.

Boosting collagen strengthens blood vessels. Pauling/Rath therapy includes vitamin C to manufacturer collagen, and lysine and proline which are components of collagen and reduce lipoprotein(a).

If you are willing and able to compound several powders, then you can aim for a final dose of 3 g/day of vitamin C and lysine, 500 mg/day of [url=https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-100-Pure-L-Proline-Powder/dp/B00WVQM9M8]proline,[/url] 250 mg/day of [url=https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Niacin-Vitamin-Powder-Grams/dp/B010RBSLRU]niacin[/url] (vitamin B3), and 700 mg/day of [url=https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Magnesium-Bisglycinate-Powder-8-Ounce/dp/B00NIJ03C0]magnesium glycinate[/url] to get [url=https://www.isotrope.com/magnesium-glycinate/](100 mg/day of magnesium).[/url] I do not know of a source of chondroitin and glucosamine powders of which I am certain of the quality, so I recommend getting those from capsules, like [url=https://naturelo.com/product/glucosamine-chondroitin-msm]Naturelo - Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).[/url] If this compounding is too complicated, or she does not like capsules, a supplement which has most of those is [url=https://saveyourheart.com/products/Ascorsine-9]Save your Heart - Ascorsine 9[/url], the problem is that it has [url=https://saveyourheart.com/the-pauling-therapy-essential-formula-ingredients/]several other ingredients,[/url] any one of which your mom might be sensitive to.

Toxic metals accumulate in the body, removing them makes people healthier, including reducing calcification. Chelators, like EDTA, remove toxic metals, unfortunately they also remove good minerals, so when chelating it is necessary to add more minerals (take extra multivitamins), and the slower you chelate, the safer it is. Chelating for [url=https://www.townsendletter.com/Chelation/chelation_extreme.htm]six months[/url] will certainly improve health. Afterwards, you only need chelation every several years to get rid of new toxins.

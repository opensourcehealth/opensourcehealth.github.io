Heart disease is primarily caused by toxic metals and nutrient deficiencies. This leads to calcification of the arteries, strokes, fibrillation, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The most important deficiencies for heart disease are lysine, magnesium, and vitamins C, D, and K2. Toxic metals include aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and thallium. Chelation removes metals, and Pauling/Rath therapy, collagen support, boron, silica, inclined bed therapy, an earthing mat, fish oil, Gotu kola (centella asiatica), delta tocotrienols (part of the Vitamin E family), and grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) can rejuvenate arteries.</p>

<h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p>To cure heart disease, take a good multivitamin which has organic magnesium and vitamin K2, to ensure a sufficient supply of magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin K2. Most multivitamins do not have organic magnesium and vitamin K2, Naturelo is one of the <a href="multivitamin.html#vendors">few brands</a> that have both. They have a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-50-plus">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-240">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-men-240">version for men.</a></p>

<p>Taking <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MXRRZTQ">calcium disodium EDTA</a> at bedtime slowly <a href="https://life-enhancement.com/pages/exclusive-interview-with-garry-gordon-md-do-oral-chelation">removes toxic metals.</a> EDTA should be taken 4 times a week for the first year, then 2 times a week thereafter, this can be scheduled with a pill organizer. If taking it every night is preferred, it can be taken every night for six months, then taken three months every year thereafter.</p>

<p>Boosting collagen strengthens blood vessels. Pauling/Rath therapy includes vitamin C to manufacturer collagen, and lysine and proline which are components of collagen and reduce lipoprotein(a). <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/the-man-who-cured-heart-disease-with-a-natural-molecule-20-years-before-cholesterol-drugs/">Chondoitin sulfate,</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557824/">glucosamine</a> boost collagen production and reduce mortality. Boron and marine collagen increase the quantity and toughness of collagen in the body. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852744/">Magnesium</a> calms the cardiovascular system, <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/hoffer_cardio.html">niacin</a> is a vasodilator, both reduce mortality. If you are willing and able to compound several powders, then you can aim for a final dose of 3 g/day of vitamin C and lysine, 500 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-100-Pure-L-Proline-Powder/dp/B00WVQM9M8">proline,</a> 250 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Niacin-Vitamin-Powder-Grams/dp/B010RBSLRU">niacin</a> (vitamin B3), 5 g/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Aging-Collagen-Wild-Caught-Hydrolyzed-Supplement/dp/B06XSZ7S1M">marine collagen,</a>, 700 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Magnesium-Bisglycinate-Powder-8-Ounce/dp/B00NIJ03C0">magnesium glycinate</a> to get <a href="https://www.isotrope.com/magnesium-glycinate/">(100 mg/day of magnesium),</a> and 60 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boron-Chelate-Powder-Extract-Complex/dp/B0845XK84R">boron chelate</a> to get about 3 mg/day of boron. I do not know of a source of chondroitin and glucosamine powders of which I am certain of the quality, so I recommend getting those from capsules, like <a href="https://naturelo.com/product/glucosamine-chondroitin-msm">Naturelo - Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).</a> If this compounding is too complicated, or she does not like capsules, a supplement which has most of those is <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/products/Ascorsine-9">Save your Heart - Ascorsine 9</a>, the problem is that it has <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/the-pauling-therapy-essential-formula-ingredients/">several other ingredients,</a> any one of which your mom might be sensitive to.</p>

<p>Silica <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2003/4/report_silicon">strengthens collagen,</a> and it should be obtained from drinking water, to avoid the side effects that silica supplements often have. Silica itself is safe, but silica has to be combined with something to be absorbed in a supplement, and that something can have side effects. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Berkey-Gravity-Fed-Purification-Elements/dp/B00FMUYU6I">Berkey water filter</a> has a fine silica filter stage which puts some silica into the water. It's not much, but because it's pure silica in water, there are no side effects. The Berkey water filter is not designed to put silica in the water, it is just a fortunate side effect of its filter. The only problem with the Berkey is that it comes with a plastic spigot, if you buy a Berkey you should get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTSKYTMStainless-Beverage-Dispenser-Replacement-inch）Opening/dp/B00SLENBQM">stainless steel spigot.</a></p>

<p>Something that helps cartilage especially in the spine, along with many other illnesses, has no side effects, and only has to be done once, is <a href="https://inclinedbedtherapy.com/research">inclined bed therapy.</a> Raise the head of the bed by some means, one way is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB654-Furniture-Risers-Supports/dp/B01FN4KGD8">with 2" bed risers.</a> I suggest a 2" rise to start, because unless there is a footboard, with a higher rise the mattress will slide down. If there is a footboard, the rise can be higher, up to 8".</p>

<p>Earthing improves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/">heart rate variability (HRV), and decreases red blood cell (RBC) aggregation.</a> The easiest way to start earthing is to put an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Earthing-Grounding-Computer-Inflammation-Reconnect/dp/B07PNGWDQX">earthing mat on a desk</a> used for typing or writing.</p>

<p>The vitamin E family contains tocopherols and tocotrienols. Tocotrienols are better for cardiovascular health, and <a href="http://www.drpasswater.com/nutrition_library/tan_1.html">delta tocotrienol is the best.</a> Annatto is the seed or extract of the achiote tree, it contains only tocotrienol, and 90% of the tocotrienol is the delta form. An Annatto supplement is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Grace-Tocotrienol-Complex-Tocopherol/dp/B001AQ1D04">A.C. Grace - Unique E tocotrienol complex tocopherol free.</a></p>

<p>Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) at 200 mg/day (100 mg twice per day) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554789/">reduced plaque score by 33% after 2 years.</a> Most supplements claiming to be GSPE, <a href="https://www.chiroeco.com/grape-seed-extract/">do not contain the compounds that work.</a> A supplement containing low molecular weight, tannin free proanthocyanidins (OPCs) is <a href="https://www.terrynaturallyvitamins.com/clinical-opc-extra-400mg">Terry Naturally - Clinical OPC extra strength.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://jeffreydachmd.com/2013/05/heartdetoxmax-and-lipophos-edta/">Lipospheric EDTA rapidly removes plaque,</a> and since it is very powerful it should be used carefully, preferably under the direction of a naturopath or doctor. Two products are <a href="https://www.vitacost.com/allergy-research-group-lipophos-edta-2-fl-oz-1">Allergy Research Group - LipoPhos EDTA 2 oz</a> and <a href="http://www.healthsavers.info/savealife_files/ProdMoreInfo/DetoxMax-MoreInfo.htm">HealthSavers - Oral DetoxMax plus.</a></p>

<h3><a id="explanation">Explanation</a></h3>
<p>A multivitamin must have a magnesium in organic form because the inorganic form, magnesium oxide, has only <a href="https://www.vitacost.com/blog/types-of-magnesium/">a 4% bioavailability.</a> Multivitamins have calcium and magnesium, calcium is essential but if it is not balanced with a similar quantity of magnesium it leads to arterial calcification. When a multivitamin has magnesium oxide, the magnesium is not being absorbed in a similar quantity, so the person will get arterial calcification.</p>

<p>Vitamin K2 is necessary to move calcium from places it does not belong, like arteries, to places where it does belong, like bones and teeth, making <a href="https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2016/12/09/the-ultimate-vitamin-k2-resource/">bones strong and teeth resistant to cavities.</a> Only vitamin K2 does this, vitamin K1 does not. Vitamin K2 in supplements is usually in the MK-7 or MK-4 form. To get the same bone building effect, <a href="https://www.vitamink2.ca/best-form-of-vitamink2">about 20 times more MK-4 is required than MK-7.</a> The typical dose for MK-7 is 45 to 120 mcg/day, and the typical dose for MK-4 is 1,000 to 3,000 mcg/day (1 to 3 mg/day). If the supplement does not say what type it is, then don't take it because there's no way to know if it has enough vitamin K2 to be effective.</p>

<p>Naturelo is one of the few brands that has organic magnesium and a significant amount of vitamin K2, around 120 mcg of vitamin K2 MK-7. They have a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-50-plus">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-240">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-men-240">version for men.</a> Their products are available in many places, including Amazon which also has a version <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06XPTH9H2">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01FYDIP4K">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/NATURELO-Whole-Food-Multivitamin-Men/dp/B01FYDCGZ4">version for men.</a></p>

<p>There are many ingredients in their supplement, to be safe, start with one a day, and after a week, if there are no adverse effects, boost that by another one a day. Keep doing this until you reach the four a day recommendation, or just before you reach a dose which has adverse effects for you. If you get adverse effects from the whole food multivitamin at even the minimum dose, you can try their one a day version, it has fewer ingredients, so it hopefully doesn't have whatever you're reacting to, it's also cheaper. They have a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/one-daily-multivitamin-women-50-plus">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/one-daily-multivitamin-women-60">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/mens-health/products/one-daily-multivitamin-men-60">version for men.</a></p>

<p>If no Naturelo product works for you, another good multivitamin is Legion - Triumph Multivitamin, which has organic magnesium and 100 mcg/day of vitamin K2. Women under fifty should take the <a href="https://legionathletics.com/products/supplements/triumph-women/">version with iron</a>, men and women over fifty should take the <a href="https://legionathletics.com/products/supplements/triumph-men/">version without iron.</a></p>

<p>EDTA binds to metals and is then excreted by the body. This <a href="https://life-enhancement.com/pages/exclusive-interview-with-garry-gordon-md-do-oral-chelation">removes toxic metals</a> including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and thallium, but unfortunately also removes some beneficial minerals which bind to EDTA tighter than calcium, like chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese and zinc. These have to be replenished with a good multivitamin. Calcium disodium EDTA does not remove calcium, because the calcium in the compound gets released whenever the EDTA encounters another metal which it binds tighter to. Only <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MXRRZTQ">EDTA which contains calcium</a> should be ingested, never take disodium EDTA or magnesium disodium EDTA, because either of those compounds would lead to a calcium deficiency.</p>

<p>Calcium disodium EDTA should not be taken with meals because it would absorb minerals in the food, and get used up before it got to the blood, therefore just before bedtime is the best time to take calcium disodium EDTA. It is best to take low doses of EDTA for a long time to avoid mineral deficiencies and not overload the kidneys. The first time in your life that you take EDTA you should take it for a longer period to remove the lifetime accumulation, afterwards it should be taken at a lower dose to remove additional toxic metals from the environment, and leftover toxic minerals that are slowly removed from bone and the brain. EDTA should be taken 4 times a week for the first year, then 2 times a week thereafter, you can schedule this with a pill organizer. If you do not want to take something a few days a week, you can take it every night of the week for six months, then take it for three months every year thereafter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulingtherapy.com/">Linus Pauling</a> and <a href="https://www.dr-rath-foundation.org/2017/04/dr-matthias-rath-biography/">Matthias Rath</a> found that vitamin C builds collagen, which strengthens blood vessels and prevents arterial calcification from forming. They also found that lysine and proline <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/effective-cholesterol-reduction-and-blood-pressure-reduction/">remove existing calcification</a> from blood vessels, the <a href="https://jeffreydachmd.com/heart-disease-vitamin-c-and-linus-pauling2">combination is better</a> than either treatment alone. Other supplements to build collagen are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Aging-Collagen-Wild-Caught-Hydrolyzed-Supplement/dp/B06XSZ7S1M">collagen,</a> <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/the-man-who-cured-heart-disease-with-a-natural-molecule-20-years-before-cholesterol-drugs/">chondroitin sulfate,</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557824/">glucosamine,</a> and <a href="http://www.organicsulfur-msm.ca/index.html">methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).</a> If you can't take lysine, try <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-100-Pure-L-Proline-Powder/dp/B00WVQM9M8">proline.</a>

<p>The Pauling/Rath therapy also includes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852744/">magnesium</a> which calms the cardiovascular system, and <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/hoffer_cardio.html">niacin</a> (vitamin B3), a vasodilator. Boron also <a href="https://boronorphanagents.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/boron-is-getting-noticed/">reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL),</a> triglycerides (TG), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Since the therapy requires many supplements, some in high quantities, it is best to take them as powders if possible and mix them into a fruit drink which you would take with each meal. Three grams of powder is roughly 4 mL, which is a bit less than a teaspoon (5 mL). If you make a drink which last three days, put in about two teaspoons of both vitamin C and lysine. Like with the multivitamin, it is best to start with a small dose and slowly work up in case there are any adverse effects. So for a three day drink, start with 1/2 a teaspoon of both vitamin C and lysine, then increase that by 1/2 a teaspoon each week, until you get to 2 teaspoons, or just before you reach a dose which has adverse effects for you. A convenient way is to mix enough for three days in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BSW5LXY">glass bottle with a sleeve</a> filled three quarters with juice, close and turn it over several times to mix it, then put that in the fridge, and drink some with each meal. It takes about 15 minutes to prepare the drink every three days, and time to buy the ingredients, so about 30 minutes every three days, or ten minutes a day.</p>

<p>After you get to your optimum vitamin C and lysine dose, then you can also slowly work to 500 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-100-Pure-L-Proline-Powder/dp/B00WVQM9M8">proline,</a> 250 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Niacin-Vitamin-Powder-Grams/dp/B010RBSLRU">niacin</a> (vitamin B3), 5 g/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Aging-Collagen-Wild-Caught-Hydrolyzed-Supplement/dp/B06XSZ7S1M">marine collagen,</a>, 700 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Magnesium-Bisglycinate-Powder-8-Ounce/dp/B00NIJ03C0">magnesium glycinate</a> to get <a href="https://www.isotrope.com/magnesium-glycinate/">(100 mg/day of magnesium),</a> and 60 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boron-Chelate-Powder-Extract-Complex/dp/B0845XK84R">boron chelate</a> to get about 3 mg/day of boron. I do not know of a source of chondroitin and glucosamine powders of which I am certain of the quality, so I recommend getting those from capsules, like <a href="https://naturelo.com/product/glucosamine-chondroitin-msm">Naturelo - Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).</a> If this compounding is too complicated, or has too many capsules, a supplement which has most of those is <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/products/Ascorsine-9">Save your Heart - Ascorsine 9</a>, the problem is that it has <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/the-pauling-therapy-essential-formula-ingredients/">several other ingredients,</a> any one of which might cause adverse effects.</p>

<p>Aluminum is toxic and the Berkey water filter <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/047373_Big_Berkey_water_filter_ProPur_lab_tests.html">removes aluminum.</a> Silica <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2003/4/report_silicon">strengthens collagen,</a> and it should be obtained from drinking water, to avoid the side effects that silica supplements often have. Silica itself is safe, but silica has to be combined with something to be absorbed in a supplement, and that something can have side effects. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Berkey-Gravity-Fed-Purification-Elements/dp/B00FMUYU6I">Berkey water filter</a> has a fine silica filter stage which puts some silica into the water. It's not much, but because it's pure silica in water, there are no side effects. The Berkey water filter is not designed to put silica in the water, it is just a fortunate side effect of its filter. The only problem with the Berkey is that it comes with a plastic spigot, if you buy a Berkey you should get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTSKYTMStainless-Beverage-Dispenser-Replacement-inch）Opening/dp/B00SLENBQM">stainless steel spigot.</a> The Berkey travel water filter costs 300$, the stainless steel spigot costs 10$, for a total of 310$. After filtering 6,000 gallons, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Berkey-Black-Purification-Elements-Pack/dp/B00BWIWW1Y">two black Berkey purification elements</a> have to be replaced. They cost about 130$, which works out to a cost of about 2 cents per gallon. Of these four heart gifts, the Berkey water filter is the most popular one.</p>

<p>Something that helps cartilage especially in the spine, along with many other illnesses, has no side effects, and only has to be done once, is <a href="https://inclinedbedtherapy.com/research">inclined bed therapy.</a> Raise the head of the bed by some means, one way is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB654-Furniture-Risers-Supports/dp/B01FN4KGD8">with 2" bed risers.</a> I suggest a 2" rise to start, because unless there is a footboard, with a higher rise the mattress will slide down. If there is a footboard, the rise can be higher, up to 8". A pack of four bed risers cost about 12$, so on a yearly basis, this is the least expensive medical treatment.</p>

This aquatic plant also slows plaque progression by reducing the adhesion of monocytes, immune cells that promote atherosclerosis.

<p>Lipospheric EDTA is a combination of <a href="http://www.heartfixer.com/CHC%20-%20Treatments%20-%20PC.htm#DeToxMax%20in%20Dilated%20Cardiomyopathy%20-%20WJ">EDTA and essential phospholipid (PPC).</a> It rapidly removes plaque and toxic metals, faster than EDTA alone. To prepare lipospheric EDTA, the PPC is whipped at high speed, breaking the material into small particles that are rapidly absorbed across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  Any material admixed with these PPC particles can hitch hike across the gut wall. EDTA is only 3% absorbed orally, but when it mixed with PPC particles it is readily absorbed. Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) removes one fatty acid from phosphatidylcholine (PC) and attaches it to cholesterol, converting cholesterol into a cholesterol ester, which is then taken by a high density lipoprotein (HDL), transported back to the liver, and excreted as a bile salt. LCAT is stimulated by PPC and <a href="https://jeffreydachmd.com/2013/05/heartdetoxmax-and-lipophos-edta/">poisoned by heavy metals</a> such as lead, cadmium, and especially mercury. Part of the reason cholesterol level rises with age is due to the loss of LCAT function due to the heavy metal overload that occurs with aging in our society. Lipospheric EDTA removes heavy metals, promotes LCAT function, and improves arterial health.</p>

<p>Because lipospheric EDTA is very powerful it should be used carefully, preferably under the direction of a naturopath or doctor. It has cured many heart problems, including <a href="http://www.heartfixer.com/CHC%20-%20Treatments%20-%20PC.htm#When%20an%20Elderly%20Patient%20Refuses%20Bypass%20-%20KC">coronary disease,</a> <a href="http://www.heartfixer.com/CHC%20-%20Treatments%20-%20PC.htm#Lead%20Overload%20and%20Carotid%20Disease%20-%20KL">lead overload and carotid disease,</a> <a href="http://www.heartfixer.com/CHC%20-%20Treatments%20-%20PC.htm#DeToxMax%20in%20Dilated%20Cardiomyopathy%20-%20WJ">dilated cardiomyopathy,</a> and <a href="http://www.heartfixer.com/CHC%20-%20Treatments%20-%20PC.htm#DeToxMax%20in%20Progressive%20Claudication%20-%20HD">progressive claudication.</a> Two products are <a href="https://www.vitacost.com/allergy-research-group-lipophos-edta-2-fl-oz-1">Allergy Research Group - LipoPhos EDTA 2 oz</a> and <a href="http://www.healthsavers.info/savealife_files/ProdMoreInfo/DetoxMax-MoreInfo.htm">HealthSavers - Oral DetoxMax plus.</a></p>

<p>With all the powders to mix and pills to take, this treatment takes around 25 minutes a day, will enormously improve heart health, and will also help with arthritis, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's. If this takes to much time, a treatment that is faster but not quite as effective, is described in the <a href="hearttreatmentintermediate.html">intermediate heart treatment.</a></p>

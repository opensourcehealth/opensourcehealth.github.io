<p>To boost your mom's health, provide nutrients including <a href="https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2016/12/09/the-ultimate-vitamin-k2-resource/">vitamin K2,</a> and support blood vessels with the <a href="https://jeffreydachmd.com/heart-disease-vitamin-c-and-linus-pauling2/">Pauling/Rath therapy,</a> which starts with vitamin C and lysine. The best multivitamin for your mom which has vitamin K2 and organic magnesium is the <a href="https://naturelo.com/product/whole-food-multivitamin-for-women-iron-free/">Naturelo whole food multivitamin for post menopausal women (iron free).</a></p>

<p>I recommend the 4 capsule/day multivitamin for your mom instead of the one daily multivitamin because old people are more likely to have a detox reaction. With the 4 capsule/day final dose multivitamin, your mom could start with one per day, and slowly increase her dose to four per day, or whatever she can take without side effects. The final vitamin C and lysine dose for your mom should be 3 g/day of each. Start her at 500 mg/day for each, and slowly increase the dose until she reaches 3 g/day, or whatever she can take without side effects. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Vitamin-Crystals-Ascorbic-Powder/dp/B00028LX1U">vitamin C</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-L-Lysine-Powder-500-Grams/dp/B00333D4VS">lysine</a> should be bought as powders, so there are no fillers and fewer capsules to take. The powders should be mixed into a cold drink that she likes, preferably a fruit juice because the vitamin C and lysine will definitely mix well in there, but milk is probably ok. A convenient way is to mix enough for three days in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BSW5LXY">glass bottle with a sleeve,</a> then put that in the fridge, and ask her to drink some with each meal.</p>

<p>The above will boost your mom's health, with a relatively small amount of time and money. It also worth doing for everyone else who is middle aged or older. To be clear, women under fifty should use the women under fifty version of the multivitamin, and men should use the multivitamin for men.</p>

<p>If you have more time and money, and she is willing to take more supplements, you can give her the health and energy she had when she was middle aged, by reducing her arterial calcification, which almost all old people have. To safely reduce calcification, the arteries must be further strengthed, to prevent bleeding and/or aneurysms. The Pauling/Rath therapy strengthens arteries, the more of it you use, the stronger the arteries. Also, soft plaque must also be stabilized to prevent it from breaking off then blocking a blood vessel when it is dissolved, causing a stroke. Gotu kola (centella asiatica) contains triterpenoid compounds that help <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2017/5/arterial-plaque-rupture">stabilize soft plaque.</a> These treatments would boost her health, and make it possible to safely use aggressive calcification reduction treatments like oral chelation, delta tocotrienol, grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), and lipophospheric EDTA, which in turn would further boost her health to middle aged level.</p>

<p>Boosting collagen strengthens blood vessels. Pauling/Rath therapy includes vitamin C to manufacturer collagen, and lysine and proline which are components of collagen and reduce lipoprotein(a). <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/the-man-who-cured-heart-disease-with-a-natural-molecule-20-years-before-cholesterol-drugs/">Chondoitin sulfate,</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557824/">glucosamine</a> boost collagen production and reduce mortality. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852744/">Magnesium</a> calms the cardiovascular system, <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/hoffer_cardio.html">niacin</a> is a vasodilator, both reduce mortality. If you are willing and able to compound several powders, then you can aim for a final dose of 3 g/day of vitamin C and lysine, 500 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-100-Pure-L-Proline-Powder/dp/B00WVQM9M8">proline,</a> 250 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Niacin-Vitamin-Powder-Grams/dp/B010RBSLRU">niacin</a> (vitamin B3), and 700 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Magnesium-Bisglycinate-Powder-8-Ounce/dp/B00NIJ03C0">magnesium glycinate</a> to get <a href="https://www.isotrope.com/magnesium-glycinate/">(100 mg/day of magnesium).</a> I do not know of a source of chondroitin and glucosamine powders of which I am certain of the quality, so I recommend getting those from capsules, like <a href="https://naturelo.com/product/glucosamine-chondroitin-msm">Naturelo - Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).</a> If this compounding is too complicated, or she does not like capsules, a supplement which has most of those is <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/products/Ascorsine-9">Save your Heart - Ascorsine 9</a>, the problem is that it has <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/the-pauling-therapy-essential-formula-ingredients/">several other ingredients,</a> any one of which your mom might be sensitive to.</p>

<p>Gotu kola stabilizes plaque, and <a href="https://plantmedicines.org/gotu-kola-proven-medical-benefits/">can treat other illnesses.</a> A gotu kola liquid supplement is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Answer-Gotu-Kola-Herb-OZ/dp/B005P0NY7G">Nature's Answer - Gotu kola herb 2 oz.</a></p>

<p>Toxic metals accumulate in the body, removing them makes people healthier, including reducing calcification. Chelators, like EDTA, remove toxic metals, unfortunately they also remove good minerals, so when chelating it is necessary to add more minerals (take extra multivitamins), and the slower you chelate, the safer it is. Chelating for <a href="https://www.townsendletter.com/Chelation/chelation_extreme.htm">six months</a> will certainly improve health. Afterwards, you only need chelation every several years to get rid of new toxins. A low dose EDTA supplement is the <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MXRRZTQ">Arizona Natural Resource - Calcium disodium EDTA 600 mg.</a></p>

<p>The vitamin E family contains tocopherols and tocotrienols. Tocotrienols are better for cardiovascular health, and <a href="http://www.drpasswater.com/nutrition_library/tan_1.html">delta tocotrienol is the best.</a> Annatto contains only tocotrienol, and 90% of the tocotrienol is the delta form. An Annatto supplement is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Grace-Tocotrienol-Complex-Tocopherol/dp/B001AQ1D04">A.C. Grace - Unique E tocotrienol complex tocopherol free.</a></p>

<p>Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) at 200 mg/day (100 mg twice per day) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554789/">reduced plaque score by 33% after 2 years.</a> Most supplements claiming to be GSPE, <a href="https://www.chiroeco.com/grape-seed-extract/">do not contain the compounds that work.</a> A supplement containing low molecular weight, tannin free proanthocyanidins (OPCs) is <a href="https://www.terrynaturallyvitamins.com/clinical-opc-extra-400mg">Terry Naturally - Clinical OPC extra strength.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://jeffreydachmd.com/2013/05/heartdetoxmax-and-lipophos-edta/">Liposheric EDTA rapidly removes plaque,</a> but it must be used carefully. Two products are <a href="https://www.vitacost.com/allergy-research-group-lipophos-edta-2-fl-oz-1">Allergy Research Group - LipoPhos EDTA 2 oz</a> and <a href="http://www.healthsavers.info/savealife_files/ProdMoreInfo/DetoxMax-MoreInfo.htm">HealthSavers - Oral detoxmax plus.</a></p>

For the osteoporosis, I recommend adding <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Aging-Collagen-Wild-Caught-Hydrolyzed-Supplement/dp/B06XSZ7S1M">marine collagen,</a> boron, and silica. Those are also good for arteries, I didn't add them to the post because the treatment was already complicated enough, and I didn't have any more room in the post. The collagen and boron are not acidic, so your mom should be able to tolerate those. I recommend giving your mom silica in drinking water, where it is an acid but the quantity is tiny so that won't be a problem.

Fish based omega-3 fatty acids and hyaluronic acid might also help your mom, but they are acids so your mom might not be able to tolerate them. There are so many other supplements for collagen, that it doesn't really matter if you miss two.

Something that helps cartilage especially in the spine, along with many other illnesses, has no side effects, and only has to be done once, is <a href="https://inclinedbedtherapy.com/research">inclined bed therapy.</a> Raise the head of her bed by some means, one way is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB654-Furniture-Risers-Supports/dp/B01FN4KGD8">with 2" bed risers.</a> However you do it, she will be healthier, the higher she goes the better, up to 8". I suggest a 2" rise to start, because unless she has a footboard, with a higher rise the mattress will slide down.

Because so little boron is needed, about 3 mg/day of boron from 60 mg/day of chelate, it's best to get it in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boron-Chelate-Powder-Extract-Complex/dp/B0845XK84R">powder form</a> and mix it into a drink along with the other powders. Because of the minimum size of a capsule, a boron capsule has to contain mostly filler.

I recommend getting silica from drinking water, to avoid the side effects that silica supplements often have. The silica itself is safe, but silica has to be combined with something to be absorbed in a supplement, and that something can have side effects. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Berkey-Gravity-Fed-Purification-Elements/dp/B00FMUYU6I">Berkey water filter</a> has a fine silica filter stage which puts some silica into the water. It's not much, but because it's pure silica in water, there are no side effects. The Berkey water filter is not designed to put silica in the water, it is just a fortunate side effect of its filter. The only problem with the Berkey is that it comes with a plastic spigot, if you buy a Berkey you should get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTSKYTMStainless-Beverage-Dispenser-Replacement-inch）Opening/dp/B00SLENBQM">stainless steel spigot.</a>

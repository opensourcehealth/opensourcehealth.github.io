Heart disease is primarily caused by toxic metals and nutrient deficiencies. This leads to calcification of the arteries, strokes, fibrillation, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The most important deficiencies for heart disease are lysine, magnesium, and vitamins C, D, and K2. Toxic metals include aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and thallium. Chelation removes metals, and Pauling/Rath therapy, collagen support, fish oil, an earthing mat, Gotu kola (centella asiatica), delta tocotrienols (part of the Vitamin E family), and grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) can decalcify arteries.</p>

<h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p>To cure heart disease, take a good multivitamin which has organic magnesium and vitamin K2, to ensure a sufficient supply of magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin K2. Most multivitamins do not have organic magnesium and vitamin K2, Naturelo is one of the <a href="multivitamin.html#vendors">few brands</a> that have both. They have a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/womens-health/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-50-plus">without iron for women over fifty,</a> a version <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-women-240">with iron for women under fifty,</a> and a <a href="https://naturelo.com/products/whole-food-multivitamin-men-240">version for men.</a></p>

<p>Taking <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01MXRRZTQ">calcium disodium EDTA</a> at bedtime slowly <a href="https://life-enhancement.com/pages/exclusive-interview-with-garry-gordon-md-do-oral-chelation">removes toxic metals.</a> EDTA should be taken 4 times a week for the first year, then 2 times a week thereafter, this can be scheduled with a pill organizer. If taking it every night is preferred, it can be taken every night for six months, then taken three months every year thereafter.</p>

<p>Boosting collagen strengthens blood vessels. Pauling/Rath therapy includes vitamin C to manufacturer collagen, and lysine and proline which are components of collagen and reduce lipoprotein(a). <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/the-man-who-cured-heart-disease-with-a-natural-molecule-20-years-before-cholesterol-drugs/">Chondoitin sulfate,</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557824/">glucosamine</a> boost collagen production and reduce mortality. Boron and marine collagen increase the quoantity and toughness of collagen in the body. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852744/">Magnesium</a> calms the cardiovascular system, <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/hoffer_cardio.html">niacin</a> is a vasodilator, both reduce mortality. If you are willing and able to compound several powders, then you can aim for a final dose of 3 g/day of vitamin C and lysine, 500 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NutraBio-100-Pure-L-Proline-Powder/dp/B00WVQM9M8">proline,</a> 250 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Niacin-Vitamin-Powder-Grams/dp/B010RBSLRU">niacin</a> (vitamin B3), 5 g/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Aging-Collagen-Wild-Caught-Hydrolyzed-Supplement/dp/B06XSZ7S1M">marine collagen,</a>, 700 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Magnesium-Bisglycinate-Powder-8-Ounce/dp/B00NIJ03C0">magnesium glycinate</a> to get <a href="https://www.isotrope.com/magnesium-glycinate/">(100 mg/day of magnesium),</a> and 60 mg/day of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boron-Chelate-Powder-Extract-Complex/dp/B0845XK84R">boron chelate</a> to get about 3 mg/day of boron. I do not know of a source of chondroitin and glucosamine powders of which I am certain of the quality, so I recommend getting those from capsules, like <a href="https://naturelo.com/product/glucosamine-chondroitin-msm">Naturelo - Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).</a> If this compounding is too complicated, or she does not like capsules, a supplement which has most of those is <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/products/Ascorsine-9">Save your Heart - Ascorsine 9</a>, the problem is that it has <a href="https://saveyourheart.com/the-pauling-therapy-essential-formula-ingredients/">several other ingredients,</a> any one of which your mom might be sensitive to.</p>

<p>Silica <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2003/4/report_silicon">strengthens collagen,</a> and it should be obtained from drinking water, to avoid the side effects that silica supplements often have. Silica itself is safe, but silica has to be combined with something to be absorbed in a supplement, and that something can have side effects. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Berkey-Gravity-Fed-Purification-Elements/dp/B00FMUYU6I">Berkey water filter</a> has a fine silica filter stage which puts some silica into the water. It's not much, but because it's pure silica in water, there are no side effects. The Berkey water filter is not designed to put silica in the water, it is just a fortunate side effect of its filter. The only problem with the Berkey is that it comes with a plastic spigot, if you buy a Berkey you should get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTSKYTMStainless-Beverage-Dispenser-Replacement-inchï¼‰Opening/dp/B00SLENBQM">stainless steel spigot.</a></p>

<p>Something that helps cartilage especially in the spine, along with many other illnesses, has no side effects, and only has to be done once, is <a href="https://inclinedbedtherapy.com/research">inclined bed therapy.</a> Raise the head of the bed by some means, one way is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slipstick-CB654-Furniture-Risers-Supports/dp/B01FN4KGD8">with 2" bed risers.</a> I suggest a 2" rise to start, because unless there is a footboard, with a higher rise the mattress will slide down. If there is a footboard, the rise can be higher, up to 8".</p>

<p>Fish oil <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/omega-3/art-20045614">helps the heart.</a> A fish oil supplement is <a href="https://naturelo.com/collections/omega-3/products/triglyceride-omega-3-fish-oil-60">Naturelo - Triglyceride Omega-3 Fish Oil - 60 Softgels.</a></p>

<p>Earthing improves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/">heart rate variability (HRV), and decreases red blood cell (RBC) aggregation.</a> The easiest way to start earthing is to put an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Earthing-Grounding-Computer-Inflammation-Reconnect/dp/B07PNGWDQX">earthing mat on a desk</a> used for typing or writing.</p>

<p>Gotu kola (centella asiatica) stabilizes plaque, and <a href="https://plantmedicines.org/gotu-kola-proven-medical-benefits/">can treat other illnesses.</a> A gotu kola liquid supplement is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Answer-Gotu-Kola-Herb-OZ/dp/B005P0NY7G">Nature's Answer - Gotu kola herb 2 oz.</a></p>

<p>The vitamin E family contains tocopherols and tocotrienols. Tocotrienols are better for cardiovascular health, and <a href="http://www.drpasswater.com/nutrition_library/tan_1.html">delta tocotrienol is the best.</a> Annatto is the seed or extract of the achiote tree, it contains only tocotrienol, and 90% of the tocotrienol is the delta form. An Annatto supplement is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Grace-Tocotrienol-Complex-Tocopherol/dp/B001AQ1D04">A.C. Grace - Unique E tocotrienol complex tocopherol free.</a></p>

<p>Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) at 200 mg/day (100 mg twice per day) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554789/">reduced plaque score by 33% after 2 years.</a> Most supplements claiming to be GSPE, <a href="https://www.chiroeco.com/grape-seed-extract/">do not contain the compounds that work.</a> A supplement containing low molecular weight, tannin free proanthocyanidins (OPCs) is <a href="https://www.terrynaturallyvitamins.com/clinical-opc-extra-400mg">Terry Naturally - Clinical OPC extra strength.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://jeffreydachmd.com/2013/05/heartdetoxmax-and-lipophos-edta/">Liposheric EDTA rapidly removes plaque,</a> and since it is very powerful it must be used carefully, preferably under the direction of a naturopath. It should only be used if the heart disease is severe, mild cases should be treated with conventional oral chelation. Two products are <a href="https://www.vitacost.com/allergy-research-group-lipophos-edta-2-fl-oz-1">Allergy Research Group - LipoPhos EDTA 2 oz</a> and <a href="http://www.healthsavers.info/savealife_files/ProdMoreInfo/DetoxMax-MoreInfo.htm">HealthSavers - Oral detoxmax plus.</a></p>

[url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170216110002.htm]Vitamin D reduces the chance of getting the flu.[/url] However Vitamin D [url=https://www.precisionnutrition.com/stop-vitamin-d]without Vitamin K2 leads to arterial calcification,[/url] so Vitamin K2 should be taken along with Vitamin D. Vitamin D and Vitamin K2 require [url=https://www.bioceuticals.com.au/mobile/article/all/vitamin-d-and-its-helper-nutrients]cofactors including magnesium, zinc and vitamin A[/url] to work well. Organic magnesium is very bioavailable, but not [url=https://www.vitacost.com/blog/vitamins-supplements/supplements/types-of-magnesium.html]magnesium oxide, which has a bioavailability of only 4%.[/url]

Therefore, to resist the flu without getting side effects like arterial calcification, people should take a supplement with Vitamin D, Vitamin K2, and organic magnesium. Supplemental Vitamin K2 comes in the form of menatetrenone (MK-4) and/or menaquinone-7 (MK-7). An intake of [url=https://www.vitamink2.ca/best-form-of-vitamink2]1,500 mcg/day of MK-4 is necessary to observably carboxylate osteocalcin, while only 45 to 90 (average of 67.5) mcg/day of MK-7 is necessary,[/url] so MK-7 is about 1,500 / 67.5 = 22 ~ 20 times more powerful. Therefore if a supplement contains Vitamin K2, but does not say what amount is in the form of MK-7, there is no way to know if it has enough MK-7 to have a significant effect. It should have at least 45 mcg of Vitamin K2 MK-7, more will have a greater protective effect, but also have a greater chance of [url=https://melioguide.com/osteoporosis-nutrition/vitamin-k2-for-osteoporosis/#vk2-cautions]causing adverse effects.[/url]

Looking through the supplements listed by [url=https://labdoor.com/rankings/multivitamins]labdoor,[/url] and by [url=https://www.multivitaminguide.org/best-multivitamin.html]multivitaminguide,[/url] only four multivitamins had Vitamin D to protect against the flu, along with organic magnesium, and a sufficient Vitamin K2 MK-7 to prevent arterial calcification. In alphabetic order, those supplements were [url=http://www.controlledlabs.com/product/orange-triad-orange-triad-best-supplement-for-serious-athletes/]Controlled Labs - Orange Triad Multi[/url] with 120 mcg of Vitamin K2 in 6 tablets, [url=https://www.douglaslabs.com/our-products/shop-by/products-a-z/ultra-preventiver-x-dl.html]Douglas Laboratories - Ultra Preventive X[/url] with 45 mcg of Vitamin K2 in 8 capsules, Legion - Triumph Multivitamin for [url=https://legionathletics.com/products/supplements/triumph-men/]Men[/url]/[url=https://legionathletics.com/products/supplements/triumph-women/]Women[/url] both with 100 mcg of Vitamin K2 in 8 capsules, and Naturelo - One Daily for [url=https://www.naturelo.com/product/one-daily-multivitamin-for-men/]Men[/url]/[url=https://www.naturelo.com/product/one-daily-multivitamin-for-women/]Women[/url] both in 1 capsule with 120 mcg of Vitamin K2, Whole Food for [url=https://www.naturelo.com/product/whole-food-multivitamin-for-men-240-count/]Men[/url]/[url=https://www.naturelo.com/product/whole-food-multivitamin-for-women-240-capsules/]Women[/url] both in 4 capsules, also with 120 mcg of Vitamin K2.
